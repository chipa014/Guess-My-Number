# Guess-My-Number
This is a game where you need to guess a number between 1 and 20 to win.
This project was developed as an exercise in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

Instruction:
1. Download the files in the repository and put them in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in your preferred browser.

Functionality:

Once you guess, the message on the right tells you whether your guess was above, below or exactly the hidden number.
A history bar on the left can help you monitor the guesses you've already made.
Your score is displayed on the right. The fewer guesses you make, the higher your score is.
There is also a highscore of the current session.
You can reset the game at any point.

The history bar is an extra feature I created myself - it wasn't in the task.
It resulted in a very awkward HTML/CSS.
At the moment of writing I'm just learning JavaScript though, so that's okay.
